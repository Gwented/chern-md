## [BEHAVIOR]
- Ends program by default when type information is correct unless `#warn` is used.

- If a `#warn` is used and `?` is used, there will be a warn (or error) that there is an issue inside of the md file in every lint check if an error is present. So it CAN stay, but it will constantly be noted.

- Binary representation.

## [Types]
i8, u8, i16, u16, i32, u32, i64, u64
i128, u128, f16, f32, f64, f128, sized, unsized,
char, bool, (maybe capital) str, struct, enum,  nil (maybe not), BigInt, BigFloat, List, Map, Set

`struct` for a structure of data.
`enum` for Enum type which can hold data with `Ready(Data)` syntax.

## [Operators]
# MIGHT EXIST
`!`: Not operator.

# MIGHT EXIST
`||`: Or operator.

`?`: Infers type and expects type consistency throughout entire `.chrn` file.  Name affects nothing.
Can be used as "I don't know" for the naming so it doesn't matter. Exmpl: name?: ? (likely illegal)
Maybe inference only works if there is one of one type? (WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?)

-- After instruction.
`!?`: Self declaring type inference that then alters props file.
!!?: Ignores the identifier or something...
invalid()
NO ALIASES PLEASE NO
!!!?: const ptr to a const char as a constexpr
--


---- REMOVE ONE
`~`: Approximation operator acts as a range. Equivalent to: 0 <= x <= 6, 0..=6.

`(range)`: Explicit range syntax. The '=' is required. `0..=5`
-----

## [Predicates]
`IsEmpty`: Checks if the given array or string within is empty.
`IsWhitespace`:

## Functions (Predicate)
`Range((range) OR ~x)`: Checks if length of string is in condition. name: str (Range(0..=5), !IsEmpty())

`Contains`([Literal]):
`StartsW`([Literal]):
`EndsW`([Literal]):


## [Sections]
`bind`: Sets the `.chrn` file to affirm the syntax of. (or `attach`, `find`)
A bind call within the actual file with serialized data takes precedence.

`var->`: Front facing definitions of the data to be serialized or deserialized.

```chrn
// If we have struct Person, it would look like
var->
    name: str
    age: u8

// But given nested data such as
    account: Account

// it would need a nest-> section
```
```
```

`nest->`: Define structs and enums **STRICTLY** within nest sections.

# DOES NOT EXIST YET
`override->`: What to default to when a language doesn't contain a particular type.
There is also a "like" category. A "JAVA_LIKE" category would have all of the int, short, logic for a batch of languages.

# DOES NOT EXIST YET
`complex->`: Define complex rules such as enum bounds.
Example:
    complex:
        State.variants = 5

## POSSIBLE FEATURES
Utilities to alter actual main file, such as trimming all strings.

Attributes ie. `#warn`, `#ign_if` (would remove anything that didn't align under condition rather than crash or warn.) `#scientific`, `#hex`, `#bin`, `#octo`

Numerics: Binary, hex, octo. Allows for notation to serialize to be a specific notation. Unicode.

Maybe more complex operations such as '/' and '*'

# No
Matrix declarations.

Unified serialization rules for any md file.
