What if the errors intuitively understood primitives?

What if the errors had their own weight's and bias's that were put through a softmax function after
training off of the source code that impacted how the program would run?

Id reader broke

THE ERRORS ARE HALLUCINATING

The enums have gone way too far

Illegal tokens still broken

Some form of structure making is broken...
